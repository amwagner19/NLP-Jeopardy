# NLP-Jeopardy
#### Thomas Scott, Anne Wagner

Analysis of several models to predict what round a Jeopardy! question came from (in which Double Jeopardy! is more difficult than Jeopardy!)

Dataset: JEOPARDY_CSV.csv including data on thousands of Jeopardy questions spanning years of the show

Models tested include:
* Naive Bayes (naiveBayes.py)
* Sparse vector logistic regression (logisticRegression.py)
* Dense vector logistic regression (logisticRegression.py)
* CNN (cnn.py)
* RNN (rnn.py
